# The match made in heaven
## Description
Many people find it difficult to look for recipes they need to make a certain dish and sometimes it’s hard to choose what drink they want to match it with. Our team has created a web application that helps people decide what food and drink to enjoy together. With just one click, users can select from a variety of cuisine types, and we will provide them with a selection of ingredients and recipes, along with a random drink recipe to match. 
 
More time enjoying, less time thinking!<br /> 


## User story
As a user,<br /> 
I WANT to find recipes for the food I want to make, and I want to get recommendations for drinks that match the food.<br /> 
SO THAT I can make a delicious meal and accompany it with a perfect drink.<br /> 

GIVEN two sections named: Food and Feeling Lucky<br />

THEN I’m presented with food name, ingredients and recipe link.<br /> 

WHEN I click “Get Drink”<br />
